# Haya - blockchain with fast finality based on EOS

Haya implements randpa finality for EOS. Randpa was inspired by grandpa.
We will publish a whitepaper soon.

# Build

```bash
./scripts/eosio_build.sh
```

# Run tests
```bash
./plugins/randpa_plugin/tests/randpa_plugin_unit_test
```

We have also coded our own blockchain simulator for testing. It 
saves us a ton of time when debugging.

Run `randpa_finality.three_nodes` test:

```bash
./simulator/simulator --gtest_filter=randpa_finality.three_nodes
 ```

# Run one node

For the purpose of this tutorial we have provided basic config files in the tutorials/randpa-tutorial/configs 
directory.

Assuming you have your executable in the build directory you can start the node
by running 
 
```bash 

./bin/nodeos --delete-all-blocks -c ../tutorials/randpa-tutorial/configs/config0.ini

If you see "Randpa reached supermajority" messages then you have successfully launched your node.

# Run multiple nodes

Running N nodes is as easy as running one with an additional step 
of setting block producers

1.Run 3 nodes

```bash
./bin/nodeos --delete-all-blocks -c ../tutorials/randpa-tutorial/config0.ini
./bin/nodeos --delete-all-blocks -c ../tutorials/randpa-tutorial/config1.ini
./bin/nodeos --delete-all-blocks -c ../tutorials/randpa-tutorial/config2.ini
```
 
2.Set block producers
```bash
./../tutorials/randpa-tutorial/setup.sh <your-wallet-pass>
```

3.Check for "Randpa reached suppermajority" messages in node logs
